# Apprenticeship Funding Database for Part 145 Avionics Repair Stations
## Compiled for AEA Convention Presentation
### Last Updated: February 14, 2026
### Research Agent: Frank | Confidence levels noted per entry

> **KEY CONTEXT:** Most of these programs require the shop to be a **Registered Apprenticeship sponsor** (through Fastport, a state apprenticeship agency, or DOL's Office of Apprenticeship). This is the critical prerequisite. If you're not a registered sponsor yet, start there — Fastport (fastport.com) specializes in helping employers set this up, especially for veteran hiring.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Administering Agency** | U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |
| **Official URL** | https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/on-the-job-training-apprenticeships/ |
| **Rates Page** | https://www.va.gov/education/benefit-rates/post-9-11-gi-bill-rates/ |

### Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) — THE BIG ONE
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Monthly Housing Allowance** | Based on E-5 with dependents BAH rate for the employer's ZIP code |
| **Payment Scale** | 100% of BAH for first 6 months → 80% → 60% → 40% → 20% for remaining |
| **Books & Supplies** | Up to $1,000 per academic year |
| **Who Gets Paid** | The **veteran/apprentice** gets the stipend — NOT the employer |
| **Cost to Employer** | $0 — VA pays the apprentice directly |
| **Typical Monthly Stipend** | $1,500–$3,000+/month depending on ZIP code (first 6 months) |

### Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (Chapter 30) — FY2025/2026
| Period | Monthly Payment |

| Second 6 months | $1,384.90 |

| Remaining training | $172.55 |

### How a Part 145 Shop Gets Approved
1. Register as a DOL Registered Apprenticeship sponsor (through Fastport or your state)
2. Contact your **State Approving Agency (SAA)** to get the apprenticeship program approved for VA benefits
3. Submit **VA Form 22-8865** (Employer's Application to Provide Job Training)
4. SAA reviews and approves the program
5. Veterans apply for benefits through VA

| 💰 **Potential Amount** | $1,500–$3,000+/month per veteran apprentice (paid to the apprentice) |
| 📊 **Difficulty** | Moderate (one-time setup with SAA, then ongoing) |
| 🏷️ **Categories** | Wages (supplement), Housing, Training, Books/Supplies |
| ⏰ **Deadline Type** | Rolling — once approved, any eligible veteran can use it |
| ✅ **Confidence** | **HIGH** — va.gov and military.com sources |
| **Requires RA Sponsor Status** | ✅ Yes |

**Source URLs:**
- https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/on-the-job-training-apprenticeships/
- https://www.military.com/education/gi-bill/gi-bill-apprenticeship-and-ojt-program.html
- https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/valor.asp

> **💡 VALUE PROPOSITION FOR SHOPS:** You hire a veteran. You pay them your normal wages. VA ALSO pays them a monthly housing allowance on top of your wages. This makes the job more attractive to veteran candidates at zero cost to you. Notable: **Cessna Aircraft, Gulfstream Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney** have all used this program.

## 4. WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Administering Agency** | U.S. DOL / ETA, administered locally through Workforce Development Boards |
| **Official URL** | https://www.apprenticeship.gov/investments-tax-credits-and-tuition-support/workforce-innovation-and-opportunity-act |
| **Federal Resources Playbook** | https://www.apprenticeship.gov/sites/default/files/playbook.pdf |
| **Find Your Local Board** | https://www.careeronestop.org/ |

### Three Ways Shops Access WIOA Funding:

**A. Related Training & Instruction (RTI)**
- Funded through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs)
- Your program must be on the state's Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL)
- Registered Apprenticeship programs are often automatically eligible for ETPL
- Can fund classroom/technical instruction for apprentices

**B. On-the-Job Training (OJT) Contracts**
- OJT contracts typically reimburse **50% of the apprentice's wage rate**
- Funded through contracts (not ITAs)
- Can cover one or multiple apprentices

**C. Supportive Services**
- WIOA formula funds can provide transportation, childcare, tools, books, uniforms
- Can be bundled with ITA funding

| 💰 **Potential Amount** | Varies by local board — OJT reimbursement is typically 50% of wages; ITAs vary by state ($2,000–$10,000+) |
| 📊 **Difficulty** | Moderate (requires relationship with local Workforce Development Board) |
| 🏷️ **Categories** | Training, Wages (partial reimbursement), Tools, Books, Supportive Services |
| ⏰ **Deadline Type** | Rolling — funds allocated annually to local boards |
| ✅ **Confidence** | **HIGH** — apprenticeship.gov source |
| **Requires RA Sponsor Status** | ✅ Yes (for apprenticeship-specific funding) |

> **💡 HOW TO START:** Walk into your local American Job Center (find at careeronestop.org) and say "I'm a registered apprenticeship sponsor and I want to discuss WIOA funding for my apprentices." That's it.

### What's Happening
Congress passed **Workforce Pell** in summer 2025, expanding Pell Grant eligibility to shorter-term training programs. This includes the **Related Technical Instruction (RTI)** component of Registered Apprenticeship programs.

### Current Status (as of Feb 2026)
- Draft rules negotiated December 2025
- Proposed regulations expected early 2026 for public comment
- Final rules expected late spring 2026
- **NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR USE** — still in rulemaking

### Requirements for RTI to Qualify
- RTI must be delivered by a provider eligible for federal student aid (typically a community college or accredited institution)
- Must meet criteria in the law and forthcoming regulations
- Governors will play a large role in deciding which programs qualify (varies by state)

### Maximum Pell Grant Amount
- Up to **$7,395/year** (2025-26 award year) for eligible students
- Workforce Pell amounts for short-term programs will be prorated

| 💰 **Potential Amount** | Up to $7,395/year per apprentice (prorated for program length) |

| ✅ **Confidence** | **MEDIUM** — law passed, but rules not finalized. Implementation details could change. |
| **Requires RA Sponsor Status** | ✅ Yes |

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is real legislation that passed, but it's NOT available yet. Don't tell shop owners they can get Pell Grants for apprentices today. Coming soon — likely late 2026 or early 2027 for first disbursements.
